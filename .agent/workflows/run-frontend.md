# Run Frontend Application

Follow these steps to start the Next.js frontend application:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\chiru\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\mock_interview_ai\phase1_frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   // turbo
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

5. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## Notes
- Make sure Node.js is installed on your system
- The default port is 3000, but it may use a different port if 3000 is already in use
- Hot reload is enabled, so changes will reflect automatically
